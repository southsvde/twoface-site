# TWOFACE — Minimal Static Site

This is a free-to-host, static site you can deploy on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.

## Quick Start
1. Upload the folder to a new GitHub repo (or drag-drop to Vercel/Netlify).
2. Deploy as a static site (no build step needed).
3. In `js/main.js`, replace the `link: "#"` values with your **Stripe Payment Links** when ready.
4. In `index.html`, update social links if needed.

## Domain
- Point your domain to Vercel/Netlify via their dashboard.
- Set `twfc808.com` or whichever you buy as the primary.

## Edit the Show Date
- The "Add to Calendar" button generates a placeholder Nov 15 @ 8pm. 
- Update the date/time logic in `js/main.js` once you confirm details.

## Notes
- Monochrome aesthetic by default—tweak colors in `styles.css`.
- Images live in `img/`. Replace `hero.jpg` as needed.
